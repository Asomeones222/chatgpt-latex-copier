# ChatGPT LaTeX Copier

![Alt text](/assets/Screenshot_1.png "a title")

## Description

**ChatGPT LaTeX Copier** is a browser extension that allows users to easily copy LaTeX equations directly from ChatGPT conversations. Initial implementation is based on Dustin Rubin's 'Copy ChatGPT LaTeX'.

## Features

- **One-click Copy**: Adds a copy button next to LaTeX elements to simplify the copying process.
- **Works with Word**: Two buttons will appear on hover, one to copy raw LaTeX, and the other to copy in MathML format which Word understands.

## Installation

### Firefox

Install the extension through the [Add-Ons site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatgpt-latex-copier/)

### Chrome

There are no plans to support Chrome, Google's policies regarding privacy and everything else don't encourage me to support their browser. Switch to [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)! You won't regret it!

## Usage

Install the extension and navigate to the ChatGPT website. LaTeX equations will have a visible copy button upon hovering. Click the button to copy equations directly to your clipboard.

You'll get a raw LaTeX or MathML string after which you can use [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to convert into you preferred format if needed.
