## Description

**ChatGPT LaTeX Copier** is a browser extension that allows users to easily copy LaTeX equations directly from ChatGPT conversations. Initial implementation is based on Dustin Rubin's 'Copy ChatGPT LaTeX'.

## Features

- **One-click Copy**: Adds a copy button next to LaTeX elements to simplify the copying process.

## Installation

1. **Download the source code**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/asomeones222/chatgpt-latex-copier.git
   ```
2. **Open your browser's extension page:**
   Firefox: about:addons
   Load unpacked extension by selecting the directory you just cloned.

## Usage

Install the extension and navigate to the ChatGPT website. LaTeX equations will have a visible copy button upon hovering. Click the button to copy equations directly to your clipboard.

You'll get a raw LaTeX string after which you can use [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to convert into you preferred format if needed.
